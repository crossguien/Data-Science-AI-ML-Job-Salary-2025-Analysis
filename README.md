# Project Overview
This project analyzes global salary trends in Data Science, AI, and ML roles for the year 2025. The goal is to understand how compensation is affected by experience level, company size, remote status, and geography using real-world salary data.

### Code Explained
Data Cleaning (pandas)

Removed missing/null values, standardized column names, and filtered out extreme outliers in salary.

Created new features for Remote Status Category, Experience Level, and Company Size classification.

Exploratory Data Analysis (matplotlib, seaborn)

Salary distributions plotted using histograms and boxplots.

Grouped data by Experience Level, Company Size, and Remote Status to compare average salaries.

Custom bar charts and error bars were used to visualize salary variance across categories.

### Insights & Visualization

Findings exported to Tableau for storytelling dashboards.

Python visuals support key insights with plots like:

Salary vs. Experience Level

Salary vs. Remote Status

Salary Distribution by Country

### Insights

Executive salaries are highest in medium-sized companies, even above large firms.

On-site roles offer the highest average salaries across experience levels, especially in large firms.

Hybrid roles underperform financially, regardless of company size.

U.S. leads in both median and top-tier salaries across all job titles.

### Tools Used
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Tableau (for interactive dashboards)

SQL & Python (for preliminary cleaning and reshaping)
